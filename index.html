        <h1>Higher Purpose Marketing</h1>
        <h2>Name Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Our Higher Purpose is how we find deep meaning
            and fulfilment in our lives by contributing to
            someone or something bigger than ourselves.
            "Many persons have a wrong idea of what
            constitutes true happiness. It is not attained
            through self-gratification but fidelity to a worthy
            purpose."
        </p>
        <p>With this in mind, Higher Purpose Marketing seeks
            to support, empower and build up the brands of
            meaningful, community-conscious independents
            who want to make the world a better place.
        </p>
        <p>I will use my skills to inspire them and demonstrate
            that marketing, in a nutshell, is a beautiful way to
            introduce yourself to more of your ideal customers.
