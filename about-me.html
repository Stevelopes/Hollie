        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Hollie Robertson, and I have worked within Marketing &
            Communications for seven years in my corporate life. Within that time, I have
            created brand guidelines and designed multiple assets for a company that
            services some of the biggest brands in the world. Implemented companywide
            communications strategies and designed and shared thousands of digital
            content across multiple social media channels. My creative and adaptable
            writing skills mean I have written on behalf of c-suite executives. I am trusted
            to uphold and consistently deliver key messages in line with brand principles. I
            am passionate about using all my corporate marketing experience to uplift and
            empower individual business owners who aim to make a difference.</p>
